gla:2D_Fighting rdf:type gla:Genre ;
    gla:hasName "2D Fighting" ;
    gla:hasAbstract "Fighting games usually feature one-on-one combat where opponents battle until a certain outcome, usually the depletion of one fighter's health. Though early 2D Fighting games offered varying interpretations of this concept, Street Fighter II defined the genre at large, featuring a roster of varied characters with a multitude of special moves, which can be chained into combos. This type of highly technical game became the standard for the genre and continues to have a huge worldwide competitive player base  today. Despite losing popularity with the death of arcades in the West, Fighting games have made a comeback thanks to online console play." ;

    gla:hasAbstract "After Street Fighter II set the template for 2D Fighting games, titles like Tekken and Virtua Fighter became pioneers of the 3D equivalent. 3D Fighting games have the same basic structure as their 2D counterparts, but combat on a 3D plane allows for more dodging, horizontal attack ranges, and a greater importance for grappling and juggling enemies in midair. 3D Fighting games also tend to be more slow-paced than 2D Fighting games." ;

These games are large-scale and take place over long periods of time, giving the player control over the growth and development of entire civilizations. Usually they feature some type of combat, which may be turn-based or real-time, and a historical or sci-fi setting. These games were very popular on PC in the mid-to-late nineties." ;

    gla:hasAbstract "One of the broadest game genres. Action games usually revolve around some type of combat where the player controls a character or avatar, and require fast reflexes and hand-eye coordination to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Many of the earliest video games are considered Action games, and most modern games contain Action elements as well. However, most modern games fall into one of the many Action sub-genres and should be labeled as such." ;
